# Welcome to bootstrap-arch

A simple, opinionated script to bootstrap Arch Linux from the LiveCD installer.

Given that it's not very often that I need to set up a new desktop/system I've opted not to invest too much time on this, hence the following aspects/tradeoffs:

* Monolithic structure
* Less configurable
* Opinionated approach


# Usage

The idea is to run this script via the installer like so `curl -sL https://goo.gl/HtC7Mf | bash -s bootstrap` or post installation on a running system for maintaining packages and other things via `boostrap-arch  post`.
